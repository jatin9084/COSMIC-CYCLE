# Cosmic Cycle

## Project Overview

The Cosmic Cycle project involves the design, analysis, and optimization of an electric bicycle. This project integrates several aspects of engineering, including structural analysis, stress and strain testing, and battery and motor calculations. The design is created in SolidWorks, while ANSYS is used for structural analysis, and MATLAB/Simulink is employed for battery and motor calculations.

## Project Components

1. **Design**: The electric bicycle is designed in SolidWorks, focusing on structural integrity and functionality.
2. **Structural Analysis**: Performed using ANSYS to assess stress and strain on the cycle's components.
3. **Battery and Motor Calculation**: Calculations for battery capacity and motor performance are conducted using MATLAB and Simulink.

## Files and Directories

- `SolidWorks_Design/`: Contains SolidWorks files (.sldprt, .sldasm) for the electric bicycle design.
- `ANSYS_Analysis/`: Contains files and results from structural analysis and stress/strain tests conducted in ANSYS.
- `MATLAB_Simulink/`: Includes MATLAB and Simulink scripts for battery and motor calculations.
- `Documentation/`: Features reports, design notes, and analysis results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **SolidWorks**: For designing the electric bicycle. Ensure you have SolidWorks installed.
- **ANSYS**: For performing structural analysis and stress testing. Ensure you have a compatible version installed.
- **MATLAB/Simulink**: For battery and motor calculations. Ensure you have MATLAB and Simulink installed.

### How to View the Design

1. Open SolidWorks.
2. Load the design files from the `SolidWorks_Design/` directory.
3. Use SolidWorks tools to view, modify, and analyze the design.

### How to Run Structural Analysis

1. Open ANSYS Workbench.
2. Import the bicycle design geometry from the SolidWorks files.
3. Set up the structural analysis parameters:
   - Define boundary conditions.
   - Apply loads and constraints.
4. Run the simulation and analyze the stress and strain results.
5. Adjust design parameters based on simulation results as needed.

### How to Perform Battery and Motor Calculations

1. Open MATLAB and Simulink.
2. Load the scripts and models from the `MATLAB_Simulink/` directory.
3. Review and modify the scripts to fit the specifications of your electric bicycle.
4. Run the simulations to calculate battery capacity and motor performance.
